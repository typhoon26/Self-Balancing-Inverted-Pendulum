# Self-Balancing-Inverted-Pendulum
Designed and implemented a PID-controlled inverted pendulum system. Built a state-space model of the pendulum dynamics, simulated stabilization using MATLAB (ODE45), and deployed real-time PID control on Arduino using IMU(MPU 6050) and encoder feedback. Project involved control theory, and hardware integration.
